                    <h2 class="font-bold">History</h2>
                    <p>Hyperbolus is a project that started in my mind palace around ~2016. Some very poorly though out
                        prototypes and a slightly better thought-out MyBB site later and here we are. Its current
                        iteration is what you are using right now!</p>
                    <h2 class="font-bold mt-2">Technology</h2>
                    <p>The site is powered by the Laravel PHP framework + various services that sync from boomlings. The
                        frontend is Vue + Tailwind. It is powered by the Hype CMS (made specifically for this and our
                        sister sites) and licensed under the AGPLv3 so with the exception of a few private modules, and
                        services free to take a peek at the source code :)</p>
